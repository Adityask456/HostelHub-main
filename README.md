We have shared the Android-based application via a Google Drive link, as we have not developed a website. The APK file has been uploaded directly to Google Drive and can be accessed using the link provided above:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VB9ukSk_QNyRL4gFSrl9x_O8qOm6xf-a/view?usp=sharing



Similarly, the complete presentation video has been uploaded to YouTube and is available at the link mentioned above. Since Unstop requires a video file to be uploaded compulsorily, we submitted a placeholder (dummy) video on the platform. However, the full and final presentation video can be viewed on YouTube by clicking the provided link::https://youtu.be/0RJyAgWBIIY?si=Pvw1j55C6PtA2K6i
